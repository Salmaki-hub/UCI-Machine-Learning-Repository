Dataset Information
For what purpose was the dataset created?

The dataset was created in a project that aims to contribute to reducing academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. 

The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment â€“ academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. 

The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
